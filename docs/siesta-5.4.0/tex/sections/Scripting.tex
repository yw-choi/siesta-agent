In the \texttt{Util/Scripting} directory we provide an experimental
python scripting framework built on top of the ``Atomic Simulation
Environment'' (see \url{https://wiki.fysik.dtu.dk/ase}) by the CAMD
group at DTU, Denmark.

(NOTE: ``ASE version 2'', not the new version 3, is needed)

There are objects implementing the ``Siesta as server/subroutine'' feature, and
also hooks for file-oriented-communication usage. This interface is
different from the \siesta-specific functionality already
contained in the ASE framework.

Users can create their own scripts to customize the ``outer geometry loop''
in \siesta, or to perform various repetitive calculations in compact form.

Note that the interfaces in this framework are still evolving and are
subject to change.

Suggestions for improvements can be sent to Alberto Garcia
